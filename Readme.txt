Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

Used int array for myArrayList.
Used String array to store results which is of O(n).
Sorting is based on insert sort but inserts value in sort order.
i.e. If there is no value in index 0 the value is inserted in index 0 of myArrayList.
If the index is not 0 and the myArrayList value is -1, then the -1 is replaced with new value in myArrayList.
If there is any other value and if myArrayList value is greater than new value, then the myArrayList value is stored in temp variable and myArrayList value is replaced with new value.
The consecutive values are moved to respective next index.
Therefore time complexity is O(n) because the sorting done on insertion where the values are already maintained in sort order.
